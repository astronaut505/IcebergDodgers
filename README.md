# Titanic Survival Prediction
​
This project is a part of my machine learning class assignment, where the goal was to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features.
## Dataset
​
The dataset used for this project is the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, including:
​
- Passenger class
- Name
- Gender
- Age
- Number of siblings or spouses aboard
- Number of parents or children aboard
- Fare
- Initial (a derived feature)
- Family size (a derived feature)
- Age group (a derived feature)
- Fare per person (a derived feature)
- IsAlone (a derived feature)
- Fare per person range (a derived feature)
​
## Machine Learning Model
​
The primary machine learning algorithm used for this project is Logistic Regression. The logistic regression model is trained on the dataset to predict passenger survival. Feature importance is analyzed to understand which factors played a significant role in determining survival.
​
## Results
​
The project achieved an accuracy of approximately 78.69% using Logistic Regression, as determined through cross-validation. 
​
Feel free to experiment with different machine learning models and preprocessing techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
​
## Credits
​
- This project was completed as an assignment for [Machine Learning II] at University of Warsaw.
- The Titanic dataset is available in /data/
